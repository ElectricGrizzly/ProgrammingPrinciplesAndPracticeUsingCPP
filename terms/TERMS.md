</details>
<details>
    <summary><strong>type safety</strong></summary>
    <p>The property that an object can be accessed only according to its definition. C++ approximates this ideal. A programmer can violate type safety by explicitly using a cast, by using an uninitialized variable, by using a pointer that doesn't point to an object, by accessing beyond the end of an array, and by misusing a union. For low-level systems code, it can be necessary to violate type safety, but generally type safety must be preserved for a program to be correct and maintainable.</p>

    <p>A set of bits in memory interpreted according to a type.</p>
</details>
<details>
